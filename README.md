# TinySDL
TinySDL is not exactly a parser library for the [SDLang](https://sdlang.org/) data language.

I develop this as part of a larger project where the other library does not provide the feature I need, which is operation at compile time.
I only implement the features I need, so you should only use this if you have a good reason not to prefer [SDLang-D](https://github.com/Abscissa/SDLang-D).

Goal of this project:
* Providing a compact yet robust D implementation
* Ability to parse at compile time
* Limited compatibility with SDLang

Non-goals:
* Full compatibility
* Write support
